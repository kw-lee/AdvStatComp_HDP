\begin{itemize}
	\item The cdf value for $n$-dimensioned multivariate normal variable comprises of $m$ multiplications of $d$-dimensional integrals.
	\item Recall the RCMVN algorithm(\ref{alg:CMVN}) : as computing each $d$-dimensional integral values, integration variables were arranged in order of increasing order of CMVN probability values, from outer to inner
	\item Permutes the block of LDL-decomposed covariance matrix, in order of RCMVN probability values of each blocks
