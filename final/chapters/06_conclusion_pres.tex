\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{\secname}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $d$-dimensional conditioning and block reordering scheme improved accuracy under the exponential covariance structure, with negligible amount of computing time and cost.
        \item The hierarchical decomposition method is effective approach for the case of smooth covariance function, such as exponential covariance structure.
        \item Simulation result were not perfectly homogenous with that of \citet{cao2019hierarchical} mainly due to distinct computing environment.
        \item Discussions:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Deal with $m \nmid n$ case 
                \item Efficient ways of estimating truncated expectations of MVN random variables.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
